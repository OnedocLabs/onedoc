The first developer-oriented document platform. Generate, host and track documents with a single API, beautifully.

‚ùì **Problem Focused**: In the modern business world, document creation and management can be cumbersome, time-consuming, and inefficient. Companies face challenges in producing high-quality documents quickly and consistently, which is crucial for seamless operations and communication. From Microsoft Word to LaTeX, to basic programming languages like HTML and CSS, none of these technologies have truly evolved, and document creation has yet to benefit from more modern solutions.

‚úÖ **Our Solution**: Onedoc is a SDK that enables developers to write documents and dynamic templates using web frameworks such as react.js, tailwind css, markdown, etc. Onedoc also offers an intuitive API that simplifies the creation of professional, feature-rich PDFs. Whether it's automating workflows, incorporating e-signatures, or utilizing AI-enhanced content, Onedoc is designed to make your document processes smoother and more efficient.

üéØ **Our Goal**: Onedoc is dedicated to transforming document management. We aim to empower businesses and developers to create, manage, and utilize documents more effectively, driving productivity and innovation in today's fast-paced, digital-first world.

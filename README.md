# Onedoc
Stop spending hours making ugly documents, and start creating a dynamic experience now!

Onedoc makes it easy for developers to generate beautiful PDFs. It is a comprehensive solution with:

* An [open-source library](https://github.com/OnedocLabs/react-print-pdf) to design your documents.
* A simple [API](https://docs.onedoclabs.com/api-reference/introduction) to generate your documents.
* A [cloud platform](https://app.onedoclabs.com/) to host and track your documents.


The first developer-oriented document platform. Generate, host and track documents with a single API.

# Why do documents feel so outdated‚ùì

Billions of PDFs are generated daily: invoices, contracts, receipts, tickets,‚Ä¶ yet there are no toolkits to allow companies to easily build them. Developers need to get their hands dirty to produce basic documents - let alone beautiful ones. This makes PDFs hard to dynamize and maintain, leading to poor brand experience and flawed analytics.

# What does Onedoc bring to the table ‚úÖ 
Onedoc bridges the gap between developers and documents. We make modern web technologies work for PDF generation: React, Tailwind, ‚Ä¶ In turn, developers can make highly dynamic documents and iterate quickly. **What used to take hours now takes seconds with our API.**

To make it even faster, we maintain an [open-source library](https://github.com/OnedocLabs/react-print-pdf) of beautiful components and templates and we offer a hosting and tracking service to better understand your documents.

# Our goal üéØ

Onedoc is dedicated to transforming document management. We aim to empower businesses and developers to create, manage, and utilize documents more effectively, driving productivity and innovation in today's fast-paced, digital-first world.

# What brought us here üßê

We previously worked with giant firms, where documents were central to most workflows. They would get passed around, get into client‚Äôs hands, and everyone would complain about their layout and lack of proper information. While at a large mining company, clients would want to see shipping information and product details on their invoices. However, the development team wouldn‚Äôt be able to update these documents because the task was too complex and expensive.
